Sometimes
You gotta wake
Answer the call
Or fall
No need to raise the stakes
When you're on the wall
Stand tall

Sometimes you gotta fill your jets
Sometimes you gotta slow your breath
Sometimes you gotta step into the Black and White
And face the thing you dread

Sometimes you gotta stand on up
Sometimes you gotta make your case
You gotta step into the Black and White
And needle that thread

Cause there are monsters and there are men
There are monsters that live in your head
There monsters that we all should dread
So join the fight
And try your might
Step in the Black and White

There are forces in this world
That mean you real harm
If your soul is unarmed
It is nothing on your phone
We need every hand
For a scrum that's undermanned

The truly good
Versus the truly bad
You better learn to discern it quickly, boys
It's the only chance we have
You better align your soul
With what's good and right
Join the only fight that's left
And scour the Black and White

For there are monsters and there are men
There are monsters that live in your head
It is the monsters who should live in dread
And fear our might
Join the fight
Into the Black and White

(So, we're not exactly dealing with terrorists here)

(Not exactly)

(But what do you want from me?)

Look me in the eye now, sir
And make a solemn vow
To become your best selves now
I know our opponent, sir
Requires nothing less
Than your absolute best

I know it's hard

The world is pain and distraction

But there's occasions met
By lesser men
Who took the lead

It must be you

It must be me

Never take your office lightly

Never take my office lightly

You must fill your heart
Make good with God
Immediately

There are monsters and there are men
There are monsters that live in your head
It is the monsters who shall live in dread
So, join the fight
Against the real plight

When monsters are real
You better forge a heart of steel
To cast the darkness from light

You gotta step into the Black and White
