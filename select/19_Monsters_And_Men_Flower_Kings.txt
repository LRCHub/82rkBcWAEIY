SEASONS OF WAR
Can we meet around the bend
Will you listen, my friend
I'm not as bad as you may think
Among monsters and men
Now, don't get fooled by the scars
Or the seasons of war
I'm just a simple man like you
Finding out where to go

Isn't it strange how some fanatic
Always love to feed the fire
The Puppeteer is sending
All his boys to kingdom come

I just dream like you do
And at times I get blue
Is this the same of "womentalk"
But I try to stay true
Here's a family man
That wanna reach out of hand
But sitting trapped inside this war
In a kingdom of sand

Isn't it strange how some fanatic
Always love to feed the fire
The Puppeteer is sending
All his boys to kingdom come

PROPHETS AND PREACHERS
Each other cross, ready to bleed and sacrifice
Prophets and preachers, ready to move into your life
Freedom that do come cheap is treasured alright
But freedom for the underdog
Means more than his own life

Call him a demon and he'll pour the poison in your cup
Build him a bomb that you'd better advice him not to drop
Freedom that do come cheap is treasured alright
But freedom for the underdog
Means more than his own life

Freedom, freedom

SILENT RIVER
Stand by the silent river, river of time
A million souls float by not really certain why
Something that I've driven by a secret holy plan
Some try to catch a tide, but it's hard to understand
The more you look, the more you try
The more you free, the inner eye
There's a mountain we could climb

Hard time, my time, skyline

If you dread the final breath, don't you hold it in
What ending 10 beginnings, goodbye to bone and skin
The love that you sent out will hit you in return
Go build the life you wanted, get up live and learn
The more you look, the more you try
The more you free, the inner eye
There's a mountain we could climb
