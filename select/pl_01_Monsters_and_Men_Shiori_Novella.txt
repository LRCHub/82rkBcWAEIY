Lingering in him
He’s made of sin, nothing in the abyss he calls
a soul
(Eating at him, there’s a rage, He hunts to
feel any little thing)
He’s desperate, sure - but even more he won’t
live another day
(Picked the wrong victim and cried “God spare
me oh please!”)
As light left his eyes
She contemplates, how her heart it aches
The memory of him keeps her warm and safe
In her bed there lies
A pile of bones and echos
Of a love that’s dead and gone
(Seen it all, been done before, cliche but it’s
real......history-)
Repeating
Over, over again
You are all the same in the end
Oh you’re restricted
(In the bitter end)
You’ve no conviction
Tell me your story now
Now ~ !
Set it in stone
Let it be known
By those who pay attention
Restricted by your own hand, the end
Smell of iron blood
Fills her lungs, stepping on them as they lay
(on a field of pain she stays. Guiding them all
to their final grave)
A soldier boy hears her voice
Leading him far from the fray
(As she cries one single tear, he’ll fall on a
sword, then they disappear)
Do you fear
Your humanity, oh it’s beautiful dear
And oh, can’t you hear
All the stories untold, I’ll make them clear
Are you the next
New chapter for me?
Written in ink, all that you think
Is a piece of history
Repeating
Over, over again
You are all the same in the end
Oh so persistent
(in the bitter end)
No more resistance
Tell me your story now
They rise and fall
And crawl to the top again
And raise their swords but never will defend
Walking on the path of the condemned
The peasant king and queen lose heads in the end
*
Reading
tales of monsters and men
Oh, it’s all the same, just nonsense
Repeating
Over, over again
You are all the same in the end
Oh you’re restricted
(Oh, I know every game)
(I’ve read every name and I know you’re all
bound by your chains)
You’ve no conviction
(Oh, I know every game)
(I’ve read every name and I know that
you’ll...)
Tell me your story now
Lalalala ~
Set it in stone
Let it be known
By those who pay attention
Restricted by your own hand, the end
